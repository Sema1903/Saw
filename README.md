If you're reading it, it means that I couldn't make the Saw Bot in the network. However you can run it local on your machine. I don't prefere README files, in my opinion it's better to make your peoject global and it's important to make it convenient, so you shouldn't read any README files in my others projects, and I have not done them.
But there you need it. 
So, let's start
To run Saw.TelegramBot on you machine, you should download all files in this repository, and just run app.py
You can add new words to the Database in dop.py. There is the string with some words, you just need to change it on your words. 
WARNING!!! Work with database currently, cause you can break it. Sorry, but I've used SQLite3. Yeah, cause it's free. Sorry again
Have a greate game!
